  * 2 cups gluten free flour
  * 1 tsp salt
  * ½ tsp baking powder
  * 2 tbsp sugar
  * 1 packet yeast
  * ¾ cup warm water

Preheat oven to 350 F.

In a small bowl, combine the warm water and yeast. Sprinkle 1 tbsp of the sugar in. Wait for it to smell yeasty.

In a big bowl, combine flour, salt, baking powder, and the remaining 1 tbsp of sugar. Whisk with a fork until combined. Then pour the wet yeast mixture into the dry bowl. Stir until combined, adding the olive oil.

Roll the crust out onto a pre-oiled baking sheet. Keep the corners high. Bake the crust for 20 - 25 minutes. Then take it out and cover with toppings/olive oil. Bake for another 20 - 25 minutes.
