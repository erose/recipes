  * rice stick noodles (half a package; i.e. 8oz)
  * oil (2 tablespoons, canola is fine)
  * fish sauce (1/4 cup)
  * honey (2 tablespoons)
  * rice vinegar (2 tablespoons)
  * scallions (2 stalks)
  * garlic cloves (2)
  * eggs (2)
  * peanuts
  * basil leaves (optional)
  * limes (1 lime; 2 tbsp lime juice)
  * tomatoes (optional)

Boil some water. Pour it over the noodles, enough to cover, and put the lid on. It will cook them.

Chop the garlic cloves and slice the scallions into chunks.

Meanwhile, combine fish sauce, honey, oil and rice vinegar in a skillet and bring to a simmer. Cut a lime and squirt some juice in as well. Put in the garlic cloves and simmer. After a few minutes, make a pocket in one corner of the pan and add the eggs. Stir them fiercely to scramble them.

Strain the noodles to remove water, then add them to the pan with the sauce. Add scallions and beansprouts. Stir to coat the noodles with sauce, and let the remaining water boil away. Squirt some more lime in if it needs it.

Before serving, add chopped basil leaves and crushed peanuts.
