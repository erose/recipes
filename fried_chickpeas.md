  * Chickpeas (1 can)
  * Onions (Â½ onion)
  * Rice (jasmine or basmati, but whatever you like)
  * Curry powder + chili powder, salt

Optional: cherry/plum tomatoes

Slice onions. Fry up (**really hot**) chickpeas and onions in canola oil, adding the seasonings. Fry until the chickpeas get very crispy. They should taste a bit like falafel. Serve with tomatoes cut in half.
