* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 medium onion, chopped
* 1 large bell pepper, chopped
* 2 medium carrots, chopped
* ½ teaspoon salt
* 4 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 tablespoons chili powder
* 2 teaspoons ground cumin
* 1½ teaspoons smoked paprika
* 1 teaspoon dried oregano
* 1 large can (28 ounces) diced tomatoes, with their juices
* 2 cans (15 ounces each) black beans, rinsed and drained
* 1 can (15 ounces) pinto beans, rinsed and drained
* 2 cups vegetable broth or water
* 1 to 2 teaspoons lime juice

Heat the olive oil in a pot. Add the chopped onion, bell pepper, carrot and ¼ teaspoon salt. Stir to combine and then cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender and the onion is translucent, about 7 to 10 minutes.


Add the garlic, chili powder, cumin, smoked paprika, and oregano. Cook until fragrant while stirring constantly, about 1 minute.


Add the diced tomatoes and their juices, the drained black beans and pinto beans, vegetable broth. Stir to combine and let the mixture come to a simmer. Continue cooking, stirring occasionally and reducing heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer, for 30 minutes. DO NOT COVER. Remove the chili from heat.

Add the chopped cilantro, stir to blend, and then mix in the lime juice, to taste. Add salt to taste, too.
