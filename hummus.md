The difference between fresh homemade hummus and refrigerated store-bought is so vast that I defy you to give two squats about the texture and flavor difference between this hummus, and a hummus where dried chickpeas were soaked overnight, boiled with baking soda, painstakingly hand-skinned for ten minutes, and blended in precious stages. Plus, this method has more fiber, and Americans are in a fiber crisis, so you need the hummus immediately, not one metric fusspot from now
