  * 6 chicken thighs
  * 1 cup flour
  * 6 tbsp Olive Oil
  * 1 medium onion
  * 5 cloves garlic
  * 1 cup chicken broth
  * 1 whole large lemon, zested
  * 1 cup rice

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. 

Heat the olive oil in an cast-iron skillet over medium heat. 

Sprinkle the chicken thighs with salt and pepper, then dredge both sides in flour. Add them, skin side down, to the pan and cook them, shaking and moving them around the pan, until the skin is golden, about 3 to 4 minutes. Turn them to the other side and cook for another couple of minutes, then remove them to a plate. If there is excess grease, pour off all but about 1/4 cup. 

Add the onions and garlic to the pan and stir to cook, about 3 minutes. Add the broth, along with half the lemon zest. Cut the lemon in half and squeeze in the juice. Sprinkle in a little salt and pepper, and let it cook for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring continually. 

Nestle the chicken thighs back into the pan, skin side up. (They should not be submerged; the liquid should come up about halfway up the sides of the chicken.) Place the lid on the skillet (if you're using an iron skillet without a lid, you can invert a second skillet on top) and place it in the oven. Let it cook in the oven for 15 minutes. Remove the lid, then spoon the sauce onto each chicken thigh. Continue cooking in the oven with the lid off for 15 minutes, making sure it doesn't get too brown.

Stir the rest of the lemon zest with a little salt into the cooked rice. Serve the chicken with the rice, spooning sauce over the top.
