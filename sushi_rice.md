  * 1 cup uncooked sushi rice
  * 2 cup water
  * 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
  * 1 tablespoon sugar
  * 1 tablespoon salt

Rinse the dry rice with water, pouring off the cloudy water, two or three times. Then cook the rice ordinarily.

Combine the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small bowl and microwave for 30 to 45 seconds. (Cover the bowl, or your microwave will smell bad.) Then pour the mixture into the rice and stir thoroughly.
