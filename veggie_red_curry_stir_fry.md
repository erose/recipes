To prepare, mince the garlic and cut the ginger into very small bits. Cut the scallions into 1/2 inch pieces. Cut the onion into small pieces (but don't dice it).

First make the sauce. Squeeze 1/4 cup of lime juice and add it to a pan with 1.5 tablespoons of the red curry paste and the miso paste. Add oil and simmer. Then add the following, simmering for a few minutes after each new ingredient:

0. garlic + ginger
0. scallions + onions
0. veggies
0. cashews
0. basil leaves

Serve over white rice.
