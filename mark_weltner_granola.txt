Combine (in pan that you’re going to bake it in; I use a 9x9 pan):

3 cups oats
2/3 cup flour (gluten free or not)

Add:
2 1/4 cups nuts
(I’ve gotten to use raw, but already toasted works, too)

Stir it all up and then add:
1/2 cup regular ol oil (I use safflower)

Stir it up and then add:
1/2 cup maple syrup or honey

Set oven to 325º and put the pan in the cold oven, let it go for 16 minutes

Take it out and stir it up, then put it back in for 12 minutes
Do it again for another 12 minutes, and then maybe another 10.
When it’s done, add a bunch of dried fruit (I usually use raisins, maybe 1/2 cup? Whatever feels right)
