  * Russet potato
  * Olive oil
  * Scallions
  * Butter
  * Seasonings (e.g. salt, pepper, garlic powder, oregano, thyme)

Heat oven to 350 F. Wash potatoes, dry, then poke holes all over them with a fork (this is so moisture can escape during cooking). Use a bowl to coat with olive oil and seasonings. Place directly on an oven rack, with a tray below to catch drippings.

Cook for about an hour.
