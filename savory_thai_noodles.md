INGREDIENTS
FOR THE SAUCE:
  - ⅓ cup tamari sauce
  - ⅓ cup packed brown sugar
  - 3 tablespoons white miso
  - 3 tablespoons tomato paste
  - 2 tablespoons tamarind concentrate
  - 1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes

FOR THE NOODLES:
  - 8 ounces Thai rice noodles
  - 3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon coconut oil
  - 1 bunch (6 to 8) scallions, trimmed
  - Kosher salt
  - 8 ounces trimmed brussels sprouts, shredded or quartered
  - 4 cloves garlic, minced
  - 2 cups loosely packed cilantro leaves and thin stems
  - 4 ounces mung bean sprouts (optional)
  - ½ cup salted roasted peanuts, lightly cracked in a mortar or coarsely chopped
  - 1 red chile, such as Fresno, thinly sliced (optional)
  - 4 lime wedges, for serving

Make the sauce: in a blender or bowl, combine all the ingredients and mix until smooth. It should be thick but pourable like barbecue sauce; add water as needed to thin it out.

Cook noodles for stir-frying according to the package directions; they should be slightly underdone. After draining, rinse well with cold water to stop the cooking. Toss noodles in 1 teaspoon coconut oil to prevent sticking.
Cut scallions: Thinly slice the white parts, and cut the pale and dark green parts into 1-inch lengths.

Heat a wok or large nonstick skillet over high. Add 2 tablespoons coconut oil and sprinkle in salt. Add brussels sprouts and sear, tossing occasionally, until browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside.

In the same pan over high heat, heat remaining 1 tablespoon coconut oil. Add scallions and cook, stirring often, just until wilted, about 2 minutes. Add garlic, stir, then pour in about half the sauce and stir until bubbling.

Add noodles and cook, tossing in the sauce until cooked through, about 2 minutes. Add the remaining sauce, cooked brussels sprouts, cilantro and bean sprouts, if using; toss to coat and heat through.

Divide among plates. Garnish with peanuts, chile and lime wedges (if using) and serve immediately.
