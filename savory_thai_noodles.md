INGREDIENTS
FOR THE SAUCE:
  - ⅓ cup tamari sauce
  - ⅓ cup packed brown sugar
  - 3 tablespoons white miso
  - 3 tablespoons tomato paste
  - 2 tablespoons tamarind concentrate
  - 1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes

FOR THE NOODLES:
  - 8 ounces Thai rice noodles
  - 3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon coconut oil
  - 1 bunch (6 to 8) scallions, trimmed
  - Kosher salt
  - 8 ounces trimmed brussels sprouts, shredded or quartered
  - 4 cloves garlic, minced
  - 2 cups loosely packed cilantro leaves and thin stems
  - 4 ounces mung bean sprouts (optional)
  - ½ cup salted roasted peanuts, lightly cracked in a mortar or coarsely chopped
  - 1 red chile, such as Fresno, thinly sliced (optional)
  - 4 lime wedges, for serving

Make the sauce: in a bowl, combine all the ingredients and mix until smooth.

Cook noodles for stir-frying according to the package directions. Cut scallions: thinly slice the white parts, and cut the pale and dark green parts into 1-inch lengths.

Heat a wok or large nonstick skillet over high. Add 2 tablespoons coconut oil and sprinkle in salt. Add brussels sprouts and sear, tossing occasionally, until browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes. Add noodles, garlic and scallions and cook, tossing in the sauce until cooked through, about 2 minutes.

Divide among plates. Garnish with peanuts, chile and lime wedges (if using) and serve immediately.
