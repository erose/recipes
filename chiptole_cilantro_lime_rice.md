  * 1 tbsp oil (canola/vegetable)
  * 2 tsp fresh cilantro, chopped fine
  * 1 tbsp lime juice (1/2 a regular lime)
  * Â½ tsp salt
  * 1 cup long grain white rice
  * 2 cups water

Sautee the rice in oil until almost translucent.

Add water, bring to a boil.

As soon as the water begins to boil, turn the heat down low.

Simmer, covered for 15-20 minutes, or until all water is absorbed.

Turn off heat. Leave it covered for 30 minutes. It may be very important that you don't peek.

Mix salt and juice of key lime together until salt is dissolved. Pour it over rice, fluff with a fork. 

Sprinkle in cilantro, and toss well to evenly coat with cilantro and lime mixture.
