* 1/2 a lime

Puree the tomatoes and onion and pour into a saucepan. Stir in the chicken stock, salt, and cumin and bring liquid to a boil over medium heat.

Saut√© the rice in oil, stirring frequently until lightly toasted and golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the peppers and cook for 1-2 minutes. Add garlic and cook for an additional 30 seconds.

Pour the boiling tomato mixture over the rice and stir to combine. Squeeze the lime over it. Simmer until the liquid is gone, about 15 minutes. Fluff with a fork. Add cilantro.
