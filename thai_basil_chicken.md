  * 1 pound ground (I used diced) chicken
  * canola oil
  * 3 shallots
  * 5 cloves garlic
  * honey or sugar
  * soy sauce
  * fish sauce
  * 1/3 cup chicken broth or water
  * 1 handful of basil leaves
 
 Saute the shallots and garlic in oil for 1-2 minutes. Add the chicken and cook for an additional 2 minutes.
 
 Add 2 teaspoons of honey/sugar, 2 tablespoons of soy sauce, and 1 tablespoon of fish sauce. Stir-fry for another minute.
 
 Dump in the broth or water. The liquid should evaporate quickly. Add the basil and cook until it wilts. Serve with rice.
