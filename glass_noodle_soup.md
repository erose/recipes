Ingredients:

  * 2 ounces uncooked bean threads (cellophane noodles) 
  * 3 (14.5 ounce) cans Chicken Broth 
  * 1 large clove garlic, minced 
  * 1 tablespoon thin strips fresh ginger root 
  * 4 2-inch pieces fresh lemongrass
  * 2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into strips
  * 2 tablespoons lime juice
  * 2 tablespoons fish sauce
  * 1 jalapeno pepper, cut into thin slices
  * 7 baby bella mushrooms, sliced
  * 2 scallions, sliced
  * 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro

Method:
Soak the bean threads in a large bowl of hot water until soft, about 15 minutes; drain and cut into bite-size lengths. 
Divide the noodles into 4 bowls.
Bring the chicken broth, garlic, ginger, and lemongrass to a boil in a large saucepan; reduce heat to medium-low and cook the mixture at a simmer until fragrant, about 15 minutes.
Cook the chicken in a small saucepan until it is cooked through.
Add the chicken and mushrooms to the soup; simmer until the mushrooms are soft. 
Stir the lime juice and fish sauce through the soup. 
Ladle the soup over the noodles; top with jalapeno pepper slices, scallions and cilantro to serve.
