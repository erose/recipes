# Quinoa/Pesto Stuffed Tomatoes

* 3 large tomatoes
* 1/2 cup no-salt added vegetable stock
* 1/2 cup water
* 1/2 cup quinoa
* 1/2 red bell pepper, diced
* 1/6 cup basil pesto
* mozzarella cheese
* cilantro (optional)

**Instructions:**

* Preheat oven to 425F.
* Carefully cut the tops off the tomatoes and scoop out the flesh and seeds. Discard the flesh and seeds.
* Bring the stock and water to a boil in a saucepan and add the quinoa. Cover, reduce heat to low and simmer for about 10 minutes. Cook until the quinoa is tender and the water/stock is completely absorbed. Place in a large bowl.
* Add the red pepper and pesto to the quinoa and mix well. Stuff the tomatoes with the quinoa mixture.
* Place the stuffed tomatoes in a baking sheet and sprinkle with cheese. Bake for 15 minutes or until the cheese is slightly browned and the tomatoes are heated through.

Garnish with cilantro.
