Serves 4

* 5 plum or roma tomatoes
* thyme
* olive oil
* salt
* pepper
* some dill
* 1.3 cups green lentils

#### Oven-dried tomatoes
Preheat the oven to 275 F. Quarter the tomatoes vertically and place skin-down on a baking sheet. Sprinkle with thyme. Dribble 1 tbsp of olive oil and sprinkle with salt. Roast for 1.5 hours, until semi-dried.

#### Lentils
Place the lentils in a pot of boiling water (the water should come 1.25 inches above the lentils) and cook for 20-30 minutes, until tender. Mix in the garlic (chopped), 3 tbsp olive oil, and black pepper. Mix in the tomatoes and mozzarella and go to town!
