If you’re vegetarianizing this, you can just use cream of mushroom soup for the cream of chicken and replace the bouillon with some salt (or veggie stock, if that’s your bag.)

  - 8 ounces Noodles, uncooked
  - 1 cube Beef Bouillon
  - 1 clove Garlic,minced
  - 1/3 cup Onion, chopped
  - 2 tablespoons Cooking oil
  - 1 pound Ground Beef
  - 2 tablespoons Flour
  - 2 teaspoons Salt
  - 1/2 teaspoon Paprika
  - 6 ounces Mushrooms
  - 1 can Cream of Chicken Soup, undiluted
  - 1 cup Sour Cream
  - 1 handful Parsley, chopped

Start cooking those noodles, first dropping a boullion cube into the noodle water.
Brown the garlic, onion, and crumbled beef in the oil.
Add the flour, salt, paprika, and mushrooms, stir, and let it cook five minutes while you light a cigarette and stare sullenly at the sink.
Then add the soup and simmer it–in other words, cook on low flame under boiling point–ten minutes.
Now stir in the sour cream–keeping the heat low, so it won’t curdle–and let it all heat through.
To serve it, pile the noodles on a platter, pile the Stroganoff mix on top of the noodles, and sprinkle chopped parsley around with a lavish hand.
