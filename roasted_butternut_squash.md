* 1 butternut squash

Preheat oven to 400F.

Slice the squash into quarters. Peel away the outer skin. Also peel away the lighter-colored inner skin until what's left is deep orange. Cut into 1-inch cubes, drizzle with olive oil. Add some good spices (???).

Roast for ~30 minutes. They will be soft enough to squish with a fork.
