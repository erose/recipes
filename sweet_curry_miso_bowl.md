**Sweet Curry Miso Sauce:**
garlic (2 cloves)
ginger root (2 tsp grated)
soy sauce (2 tsp)
lemon/lime juice (2 tbsp, or squeeze a lime and do it by ear)
water (2 tbsp)
curry powder (1 tsp)
honey (1 tsp)
miso paste (2 tsp)

This is really simple -- blend everything until smooth.

**Rest of it:**
kale (optional)
brown rice (½ cup)
quinoa (½ cup)
cremini mushrooms (3-4)
onion (⅓ of an onion)
broccoli (½ cup, optional)
shredded carrots (½ cup)
nutritional yeast (optional)
sliced almonds
raisins
olive oil

Saute the onions, mushrooms, broccoli, and carrots in oil. When they’re done, put them in your bowl with the brown rice and quinoa. Pour the dressing all over them. Add the almonds, raisins, and any optional ingredients and go to town.
